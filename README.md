Amazon Homepage Clone (Static)
This little project is a crafted, static replica of the Amazon.in homepage. Built purely with HTML for structure and CSS for all the styling and responsiveness, this clone is a showcase of fundamental front-end skills.
It includes:
Header: It contains the Amazon logo, a visual-only search bar and navigation links like "Hello, Sign In," "Returns & Orders," and your "Cart" icon.
Nav Bar: A second navigation bar packed with categories like "All," "Mobiles," "Best Sellers," and more.
Hero Section: This big, prominent area is designed to visually mimic Amazon's dynamic image carousel but it's static.
Product Grids: It consists of different product categories and individual items.
Footer: A comprehensive footer section, filled with typical Amazon links (like "About Us" and "Conditions of Use"), neatly organized into distinct columns.

Tech Used:
HTML5: Used to build the entire structure of the page, making sure everything is semantically sound and accessible.
CSS3: Employed for all visual aspects
